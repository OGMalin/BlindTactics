# BlindTactics
These are tactics file generated from Lichess's tactics with 3 - 7 pieces on the board.
The files are devided in different rating range with a thought fide rating. I used the Dojo's rating conversions. One exercise file and one solution file belong to each range.

I also did run the selection with different score in the popularity (scale -100 - 100).<br/>
<pre>puzzles_all.zip  all puzzles.

                 These exercises are what I currently are doing. Print it out on a printer that's abel to print
                 on both sides of the sheet and cut each exercises so it would look like a deck of cards.
